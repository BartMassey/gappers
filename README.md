# gappers: simulation of "suited-gapper" flush probabilities
Bart Massey 2023

This simulation and calculation is a response to
<https://www.replaypoker.com/blog/betting-on-suited-connectors-by-jengen7/>.
The code — in Python and Rust — was written by GitHub
Copilot, with a bit of guidance by me. The calculation is
entirely my own.
